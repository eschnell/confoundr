Description: This software implements three diagnostics for confounding that can be 
    used in sequence (see Jackson 2016). These apply to any study of multivariate
    exposures e.g. time-varying exposures, direct effects, interaction, and 
    censoring. The first two diagnostics pertain to the nature of confounding in 
    the data, while the third is meant to examine residual confounding after 
    applying inverse probability weighting. The third diagnostic can also be used 
    to examine residual confounding within propensity-score strata (when these 
    are used in place of covariates in the parametric g-formula). We recommend 
    that the diagnostics be applied to covariates that investigators will use to 
    control for confounding. We provide tools to help focus each diagnostic on 
    the relevant covariate history (used to control for confounding).
