Description: This software implements three diagnostics for confounding and selection-bias in complex longitudinal data. See "Jackson JW. Diagnostics for Confounding of Time-Varying and Other Joint Exposures. Epidemiology 2016;27(6):859-69" for details These apply to any study of multivariate exposures e.g. time-varying exposures, direct effects, interaction, and censoring. The first two diagnostics pertain to the nature of confounding in the data, while the third is meant to examine residual confounding after applying inverse probability weighting. The third diagnostic can also be used to examine residual confounding within propensity-score strata (when these are used in place of covariates, in the parametric g-formula, or in marginal mean weighting through stratification. The diagnostics should be applied to covariates that investigators will use to control for confounding).  Tools are provided to help focus each diagnostic on the relevant covariate history that is used to control for confounding.
